/**
 * Enum representing all the valid pahses of a game, which <i>include</i>
 * buildup phases which may only be used or exist for the server.
 * Therefore, you can get the 'next' logical phase the Program should
 * dive in with:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>{@link #getNextClient()} for the next Client-Phase</li>
 *  <li>{@link #getNextServer()} for the next Server-Phase</li>
 * </ul>
 * Currently there is no implementation for
 * getting the previous phase, as there is no case
 * present, where this should be desireable. 
 * <p>
 * The {@link #END}-Phase will always be present for both,
 * Client and Server and will point to itself.
 * <p> 
 * There are sub-phases, like 'GamePaused' which are
 * not represented with as they are considered to be
 * states and not explicit phases.
